Snake Game made using only HTML, CSS and VanillaJS


Aim of the game: Use arrow keys to navigate through the grid and eat as many food pieces as possible to expand the length of the snake. Your score depends on the length of the snake. The snake's speed increases with every food piece eaten. The game is over if the snake touches the borders of the grid, or if the snake collides with its own body.

Try and record personal high scores and compete with others!
